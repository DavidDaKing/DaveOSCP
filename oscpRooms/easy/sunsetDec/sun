  .zip file located on http apache. Password found: manuel
      - zip2john save.zip > hash.txt 
      - john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 



  Exploitation: 
      - /etc/shadow lead me to a weird restricted bash user. 
      - Ran their sha512crypt hash through hashcat under rockyou wordlists to get a Password
      - SSH'd into the machine as them, and found that adding -t "bash no profile" ~~ not exactly typed like this 
      - and typing the full command like /bin/wget . /bin/"command" breaks out of the restricted form
      - Found chkroot running through a compiled cpp program 
      - Injected a reverse shell in the /tmp/update directory -> per chkrootkit vulnerability 
      - got root
