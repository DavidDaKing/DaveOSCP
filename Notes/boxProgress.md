# Box Log:

## Progression Tracker: 


    6/24 
    - I feel more confident in information gathering and vulnerability scanning
    - When it comes to what to do with the intel gained from scanning, I tend to look at walkthroughs. However,
    I am using walk throughs less often.
    - For privilege escalation, I still look at hints/walkthroughs. 

    I felt a positive shift in my skill sets after re doing some of the THM rooms/boxes. Repeating the process has always helped me.
