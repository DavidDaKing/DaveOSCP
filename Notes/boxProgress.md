# Box Log:

## Progression Tracker: 


    6/24 
    - I feel more confident in information gathering and vulnerability scanning
    - When it comes to what to do with the intel gained from scanning, I tend to look at walkthroughs. However,
    I am using walk throughs less often.
    - For privilege escalation, I still look at hints/walkthroughs. 

    I felt a positive shift in my skill sets after re doing some of the THM rooms/boxes. Repeating the process has always helped me.

    8/23 
    - I can go through any easy&intermediate room w/o looking at a walkthrough 100%
    - For Linux Privilege escalation, I am rock solid
    - I am weak in windows privilege escalation
    - I am starting to grasp the basics of tunneling and port refowarding.
