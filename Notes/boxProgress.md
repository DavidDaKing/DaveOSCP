# Box Log:

## Progression Tracker: 


    6/24 
    - I feel more confident in information gathering and vulnerability scanning
    - When it comes to what to do with the intel gained from scanning, I tend to look at walkthroughs. However,
    I am noticing a change in that as I'm looking at them less and less.
    - For privilege escalation, I still look at hints/walkthroughs 

    I felt a positive shift in my skill sets after re doing some of the THM rooms/boxes.
