**The Fox and the Drone**

A hungry Fox wandered through the edge of a village, where he saw a shining object buzzing above the farmer's field.

It was a Drone—swift, sleek, and humming with pride. It hovered effortlessly in the air, taking photos of the world below.

"Why walk when I can fly?" the Drone called down. "Look at you, stuck on the ground, always searching for scraps. I see everything from above and never get my paws dirty."

The Fox narrowed his eyes. "Impressive. But do you ever land?"

"Why would I?" scoffed the Drone. "Up here, I’m untouchable!"

Just then, its battery warning blinked red.

The Drone started descending, slower than it liked, until it landed clumsily in the middle of the field. Before it could take off again, the farmer’s curious dog came trotting over, teeth bared.

The Fox chuckled from the hedges.

"Seems the sky’s not so safe after all," he murmured, and trotted off in search of supper.
