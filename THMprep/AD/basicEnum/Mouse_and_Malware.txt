**The Mouse and the Malware**

A curious Mouse lived in the server room of a great company. Though small, he was clever and always nosing about. One day, while sniffing near a terminal, he spotted something strange—a shiny USB drive left dangling from a port.

The Mouse scampered up and tapped it.

"Who left you here?" he asked.

"I am a Gift," whispered the USB drive slyly. "Plug me in, and I will show you secrets, shortcuts, and shiny tools you’ve never seen. Admin access is just a click away."

The Mouse hesitated. "But the humans say not to trust strange devices."

"Pfft," said the USB. "They just want to keep the good stuff for themselves."

Tempted by promises of forbidden knowledge, the Mouse nudged the drive deeper into the port. Instantly, red lights flashed. The screen turned black. Alarm bells rang across the building. From the shadows, a Malware rat emerged, grinning.

"Thanks for the access, little one," it sneered, as it disappeared into the system.

Guards rushed in. Technicians cursed. The Mouse squeaked and fled into a crack in the wall, ashamed.

He never went near a dangling USB again.
